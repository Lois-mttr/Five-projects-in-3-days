# Five projects in 3 days

Have you ever had a task that scared you to death? Well, that happened to me... The truth is that it was a challenge to start in the world of web programming, but thanks to my friends I managed to learn everything I needed to be able to do it.

The five projects that can be found are:
- Personal Recipes Catalog
- Personal Expenses Register
- Task Management System (To-Do List)
- Basic Contact Manager
- Library of Read Books
